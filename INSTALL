Installation Instructions
*************************

The following six step process can be used to install ITVal in most
circumstances.  If installation using this process fails, file a bug report at http://itval.sourceforge.net.

In order for installation to succeed, the following dependencies are required:
	FDDL Library, FLEX, BISON

The FDDL Library can be downloaded at 
	https://github.com/atomopawn/FDDL

Instructions for installing FDDL are included.

Step 1.  Create a build directory inside the ITVal directory by typing "mkdir build".
Step 2.  Enter the build directory, by typing "cd build".
Step 3.  Type "cmake ..".
Step 4.  Type "make".
Step 5.  Become superuser.
Step 6.  Run "make install".

By default, the "ITVal" binaries will be installed to /usr/local/bin and the
FDDL libraries will be installed to /usr/local/lib.  Make sure that your
environment settings (i.e. your PATH variable) reflect these locations.

Installation Extras
===================

By default, the "ITVal" binaries are installed to /usr/local/bin.
Make sure that your environment settings (i.e. your PATH variable) reflect
these locations. 

To change where the files are installed, this can be 
done during step 3 using the command:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=location_for_installation ..

To enable debugging flags, during step 3 add this command:

	-D BUILD_TYPE=true

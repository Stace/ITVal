ITVal-1.1: March 17, 2007 Robert Marmorstein
	ASSERT statements now take a "HISTORY" flag that will list the rules
	directly related to the failure or success of an assertion.

ITVal-1.0: Feb 3, 2007 Robert Marmorstein
	Added RPM packages and a gentoo ebuild.  Debian support has been
	delayed until I can find someone willing to maintain a Debian 
	package.

ITVal-0.99: Feb 1, 2007 Robert Marmorstein
	**** THIS RELEASE BREAKS COMPATABILITY WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS ****
	Pre-release of ITVal-1.0 for beta testing purposes.  ITVal now
	features witnesses and counterexamples in addition to the new ASSERT
	structure.  I have also fixed several bugs and
	support for equivalence classes.

	*IMPORTANT*  
	The syntax of the ACCEPT and DROPPED conditions 
	has changed!  Instead of doing:

	QUERY SADDY INPUT FROM 192.168.1.* AND ACCEPTED;

	The syntax is now:

	QUERY SADDY FROM 192.168.1.* AND ACCEPTED INPUT;

	This allows you to do things like:

	QUERY SADDY FROM 192.168.1.* AND ACCEPTED INPUT OR ACCEPTED
	FORWARD;

ITVal-0.8: June 17, 2006 Robert Marmorstein
	Began preliminary support for guided repair.  Adding history options
	to the MDD library.  Redesigning the GUI in QT/KDE.  Fixed several
	memory leaks in Topology handling.

	Added "ACCEPTED" and "DROPPED" primitive conditions that specify the
	set of accepted and dropped packets respectively.  Queries no longer
	automatically intersect the query condition with "ACCEPTED".  This
	allows the user to generate more complex and interesting queries
	such as:
	QUERY FROM 192.168.1.* AND ((FOR TCP 25 AND ACCEPTED) OR (FOR 22 AND
	      DROPPED));
	
	Added "ASSERT" statements. ASSERT allows the user to check whether 
	two conditions are equivalent or if one is a subset of the other.  
	The syntax of ASSERT is: 
	
	ASSERT <condition> <operator> <condition>;

	where <operator> is either "IS" or "SUBSET OF".
	

ITVal-0.7: April 26, 2006 Robert Marmorstein
        ITVal now supports ranged addresses in queries and group/service
        definitions.   For instance, you can use the query: QUERY FROM
        192.168.1.[10-20] to specify a group of adjacently addresses hosts;
        Support for INFACE and OUTFACE queries has also been improved and more
	work on the equivalence classes and GUI has been done.  They should 
	still be considered beta features, though.

ITVal-0.6-r1: March 7, 2006 Robert Marmorstein
	ITVal now ignores "PKTTYPE = <blah>" style conditions in the options
	section of the rule table.  Also fixed a bug that caused segmentation
	faults when no topology file was given.  ITVal now "creates"
	interfaces on the fly as it detects them in the rule file and the
	query file.  It is always better to specify them in the topology file,
	though, so that ITVal knows what IP address to use for MASQUERADING
	and REDIRECT.

ITVal-0.6: March 6, 2006 Robert Marmorstein
	Birthday "release".  Fixed a bug in handling of interfaces not
	explicitly mentioned in the topology file.  Before, if ITVal came
	across an unmentioned interface, it silently renamed that interface to
	'*'.  Now, it adds the interface to the topology list and gives it a
	bogus address, which I think is better default behavior.  Also added
	rudimentary support for handling topology files with multiple
	firewalls.  However, the new system just takes the topology file of
	the 'last' filter rather than trying to merge and rename them.

	Also, added a preliminary man page for ITVal.
   
ITVal-0.5: January 11, 2006 Robert Marmorstein
	Implemented a new "CLASSES" query which decomposes the set of all IP
	addresses into groups based on how the firewall treats all packets
	originating from or destined for them.  Two hosts in an equivalence
	class are always treated identically by the firewall with respect to
	filtering.  This is useful for visualizing the firewall configuration
	and potentially for future development of the tool.
	
ITVal-0.4-r3: December 13, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
	 Fixed some memory access bugs that caused ITVal to crash when
	 the parser freed names already freed by the MDD query constrution
	 code.  Also changed the output of the "Ports" subject to be more
	 readable.  Fixed other minor problems.  ITVal now ignores
	 "MASQUERADE" and "REDIRECT" targets.  It used to NAT them to
	 127.0.0.1, which is not realistic.  (It had no topology file to work 
	 with at that point).  Now that we have the topology file, implementing 
	 realistic MASQ is on the TODO list and ITVal temporarily 
	 ignores these targets.
	 
ITVal-0.4-r2: December 13, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Fixed a bug in src/chains.cc and src/iface.cc that caused ITVal to
    crash when encountering a "strange" target like TCPMSS.
    
ITVal-0.4-r1: December 13, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Fixed a bug in Makefile.am that broke "make dist" so that .h files
    were not distributed with the package.

ITVal-0.4: November 9, 2005 Robert Marmorstein 
   Queries may now use the "INFACE" and "OUTFACE" operators to specify
   a network interface for incoming or outgoing connections.  These
   queries only make sense when using the verbose firewall input.

ITVal-0.4: November 8, 2005 Robert Marmorstein 
    Introduced several changes to the command line.  The -f command
    loads a "normal" filter file.  The -F command loads a verbose filter
    file.  Similarly, -n loads a normal NAT file, while -N loads a
    verbose NAT file.  I believe it is a bad idea to mix and match file
    types for a single firewall.  Firewalls specified with the -f and -n
    flags assume that every rule matches ALL interfaces.  To use -F and
    -N, a topology file MUST be specified.

ITVal-0.4: November 2, 2004 Robert Marmorstein 
    Changed the format of the command line options to allow reordering
    of the flags.   Multiple NAT files are now associated with the most
    recent filter file.  Topology files can be specified with the -t
    flag.

ITVal-0.4: November 1, 2005 Robert Marmorstein 
    Added support for topology files.  Each line of the topology file
    consists of a space seperated list of the form: 
    <interface> <ip address>

ITVal-0.4: November 1, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Migrated ITVal make system to use the GNU autoconf tools.

ITVal-0.3: August 5, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Primarily a bugfix release.  Some improvements to the printing
    system and some preparation for interface support.

ITVal-0.2: April 30, 2005 Robert Marmorstein
    Introduced several bugfixes, added support for NAT and for
    analysis of multiple serially connected firewalls.

ITVal-0.1: October 15, 2004 Robert Marmorstein
    Initial release of ITVal.  Support for simple queries on a single
    firewall.
